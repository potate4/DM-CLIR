          "title": "Leather and footwear: The next big export frontier for Bangladesh",
          "body": "When Bangladesh s export story is mentioned, garments usually dominate the headline. Yet beneath that louder narrative, another sector has been steadily gaining international attention. The leather and footwear industry, once known mainly for exporting raw hide, is now quietly positioning itself as one of Bangladesh s most promising export frontiers. Industry insiders say the shift is real, and it is evident in the stories of those who left comfortable lives abroad to return and build something from scratch. As of 2025, the industry is ranked among the top global players. Bangladesh is the 18th largest exporter in the global footwear market. Last fiscal year (FY2024-25) saw a surge in footwear exports, and earnings rose more than 34 per cent. Numbers rarely lie. They point to a sector that is waking up properly, not by accident, but because the ingredients are finally starting to align. However, statistics alone do not capture why this sector feels different now. You understand it better when you hear someone like Sara Hossain speak. Md Saddam Hossain, Quality Assurance Officer, Craftsman Hossain is the Corporate Director of Craftsman Footwear and Accessories, someone who had every reason to stay in Canada after living there for 18 years. A stable job, a predictable life, a child settled in school a routine that worked without friction. Yet, none of it felt like it was building anything. When her father floated the idea of a shoe factory, she hesitated. But took the chance. She arrived knowing nothing about making shoes. She learnt by walking the factory floor with her father and realising how many hands touch one pair before it reaches a shelf. We have no idea how many people are involved in making just a pair of shoes. There is so much that goes into making them comfortable and look good, she says. Her creativity found a home in this repetitive craft. She also noticed almost immediately that Bangladeshis are incredibly trend-sensitive. Yet, the local shelves still look the same. Designing for a market that wants variety but has very few people producing it felt like a chance worth fighting for. As she observed, People follow global trends, but locally we still see the same designs in stores. That sense of possibility is one of Bangladesh s biggest advantages. Labour costs remain competitive. Raw materials are available at home. Buyers from Europe and North America are already watching because the pricing and quality have improved. The government recognises the sector as a priority for investment under the Bangladesh Investment Development Authority (BIDA) and has created incentives to support it. Still, the road is anything but smooth. There are deep challenges the country must acknowledge. Many tanneries and leather units operate far below capacity. The export basket is still too heavy on raw hides and semi-processed products that earn little compared to finished shoes and bags. Countries like China, Vietnam and India capture the markets Bangladesh aims for because they mastered finishing, branding and consistency long ago. Skill shortages remain a major bottleneck. The number of actual designers is low. Many who claim the title are technicians or hobbyists. When I am hiring someone whom I call a designer, he is not actually a designer, Hossain said. He is basically a technician or maybe a student out of passion. Financing is another hurdle. Entrepreneurs struggle with collateral demands, high interest rates, and banks that treat the sector as high risk. Foreign investment remains far below potential. Buyers abroad still associate Bangladesh with raw leather, not luxury finishing, which creates a credibility gap. Even when manufacturers want to scale, the supply chain slows them down. Without proper backend finishing capabilities, much of the leather has to be sent to China for processing and then bought back at a higher price. That adds delays and uncertainty. Local inspection is often impossible when shipments come from abroad, leaving room for inconsistency. I have to buy my own leather at a higher price after it goes to China and comes back, Hossain said. Despite this, people like Sara Hossain remain in the trade. Their factories employ hundreds. Her reflections on Bangladesh s chaos are painfully relatable. She does not thrive in it. She developed routines to survive it. Good shoes, she says, are defined by comfort, quality and proportion. If you forget you are wearing them after a day at the office, then they have done their job. The process is long and meticulous. A single pair takes around two to three hours. Some things remain proudly manual, such as finishing touches, hand-painted areas, and details that machines cannot replicate. Even with machinery, the final eye must be human. In her factory, it is still about 60 per cent manual and 40 per cent automated. Handmade things have their own finishing, and that s the uniqueness, she said. Hossain believes Bangladesh has not yet formed its own design language but is slowly getting there. She builds collections with trends in mind but adjusts for weather, local habits, and the demographic she is serving. Comfort testing happens in multiple rounds, and she relies on real users to point out issues. Sourcing remains largely local at around ninety per cent, but limitations in processing force her to rely on other countries for the rest. Exporting is difficult because buyers want premium finishing but do not want to pay a premium price. Logistics issues and port delays add another layer of frustration. Her vision for the future is simple but ambitious. Sara Hossain wants people to pick up local products and recognise the value without comparing them to foreign brands first. She wants longevity and sustainability to matter. Under the right conditions with investment, policy support and infrastructure, Bangladesh s leather and footwear sector can become a major growth driver. It already has the labour, the demand, the raw materials and the ambition. What it needs now is a cleaner system, better financing, improved compliance and a national commitment to value-added production. The foundation is here. The momentum is real. The question now is whether Bangladesh is willing to step fully into a future it has already begun building. Photo: Shourav Kabir Location: Craftsman Footwear Accessories",

          "title": "Bangladesh-India ties: A tragicomedy where populists take centre stage",
          "body": "There is a tragicomedy in watching two neighbouring countries bound by geography drift apart like two sailors jumping ship in different directions, each convinced the other is sinking faster. This applies to both Bangladesh and India that have apparently decided, one more than the other, that centuries of shared culture, cuisine, and history are insufficient grounds to maintain even basic norms of engagement. What we are witnessing today is not merely a diplomatic crisis. It is a masterclass in how not to conduct foreign policy politically. At the heart of prevailing tensions lies the narrative of extremism, a trusted old poison that keeps on giving. As Shakespeare would say, \"A plague o' both your houses!\" Mercutio's dying curse feels uncomfortably apt for what we are witnessing. Two nations seem determined to forgo civility in their relations, while extremists on both sides profit from the carnage. It is a show in which mobs replace politicians, and media and WhatsApp gladiators substitute for statesmen. In India, saffron extremists and propaganda machines have found Bangladesh to be a convenient punching bag a replacement for the increasingly inconvenient Pakistan or China cards. The \"termites\" rhetoric, periodic stray comments on Bangladesh's sovereignty, BJP's Mamata factor, and prime-time studio shouting champions have together achieved what decades of politics could not: they have united Bangladeshis across party lines in irritation with Delhi politics. But let us not pretend that extremism flows only downstream from the Ganges. Bangladesh's interim government today presides over a landscape where the mob culture has become a lived reality, displaying a persistent inability to counter violence effectively. Whether helpless or an accomplice in this episode, the government cannot escape responsibility for the rise of these violent forces. To be fair, post-uprising volatility is hardly unprecedented. But prolonged inaction only emboldens those who thrive on chaos. India's predicament, on the other hand, is self-inflicted. Having bet heavily on Awami League for so long, Delhi now faces genuine anti-Indian sentiment not propaganda, just consequences. Meanwhile, India's political and social hysteria since July 2024 continues to feed on narratives repeatedly debunked by objective media, yet the religious card keeps being played. Of course, we cannot deny that minorities face some threats, but so do the general public. Delhi's selective amnesia in this regard are almost amusing. It conveniently forgets that the demands of the July 2024 uprising were apolitical and met with state bullets before the eventual ouster of the Awami regime. Saffron politicians might do well to tally their own cards, assuming that they are still capable of moral self-reflection. The absurdity has peaked most recently when Siliguri hoteliers imposed a ban on Bangladeshi tourists. Apparently, extremism now checks passports at reception. One doesn't need to imagine what the Indian public have been fed about Bangladeshis all this time. It is also evident that Indian politics is experiencing what diplomats might politely call \"challenges.\" These challenges relate to some harsh reality checks. The Trump administration delivered reality check number one: Washington, it turns out, has little patience for hegemonic ambitions unsupported by regional clout. The trade imbalance with China offered reality check number two, as fiery anti-China rhetoric at domestic rallies does not equal decoupling. The Pahalgam fallout brought reality check number three, as political choruses solve nothing. And the fourth is a classic: Dhaka, once the BJP's favourite electoral dish, has left the table. Is blaming Bangladesh fair, then? Let us not forget that Professor Muhammad Yunus had wanted to visit Delhi before Beijing, and has tried to engage politically on various occasions. Delhi's response? Continued disengagement, suggesting a preference for sulking over statesmanship until Bangladesh holds the elections. Diplomacy requires reading the room, but Delhi appears content to wait outside. This inaction enabled mobs in Delhi's security heartland, Chanakyapuri, to stage an arrogant spectacle against the Bangladesh High Commission, following similar incidents in Agartala and Kolkata. High Commissioner Riaz Hamidullah's professional response to denial of mob activities by his counterparts deserves to be studied in diplomatic academies, as do the political failures that made such scenes possible in the first place. Indian High Commissioner Pranay Verma, it should be acknowledged, also showed professionalism, refraining from publicly sensationalising diplomatic summons. Yes, some protesters attempted to march towards Indian diplomatic missions in Bangladesh. There have been regrettable incidents of stone-pelting as well. But the Indian response came from the same crowd peddling Akhand Bharat, while periodically questioning Bangladesh's sovereignty. Sanity has, however, prevailed for now. Both governments have taken steps to prevent further escalation and to protect diplomatic premises. The question worth asking is this: what did those who mobilised mobs against diplomatic missions expect to achieve? Indians must accept the reality that they will have to maintain even-handed relations with Bangladesh regardless of which party governs in Dhaka. Bangladeshis, for their part, must accept that India cannot, and will not, de-securitise its relationship with its eastern neighbour given its national security compulsions. But there lies a political lesson, too. Delhi, having lectured Bangladesh on extremism for years, now finds itself courting the Taliban. When your diplomatic dance card includes the very extremists that your own rhetoric previously vilified, your moral high ground starts to look suspiciously like quicksand. Meanwhile, Beijing and Washington watch from the balcony as two key partners in their respective Asian strategies squabble over the last samosa while the restaurant burns. Both know this antagonism serves neither their interests nor regional stability. They might have found it entertaining had geoeconomics not chosen this precise moment to redraw the geopolitical map. What, then, must be done? Bangladesh must ensure its domestic security ahead of the 2026 elections, which will determine its future stability. The armed forces, bureaucracy, and political parties must forge an immediate consensus to maintain order and neutralise extremism, wherever it originates. Bangladesh should remain open to normalisation with Delhi. Reciprocity, naturally, is non-negotiable. India, meanwhile, should seriously consider whether its current approach serves any purpose beyond feeding nationalist television. Minority persecution in India, documented year after year in international religious freedom reports, has not gone unnoticed, while restricting people-to-people contact has only proved counterproductive. Walls may make headlines, but bridges make progress. For Delhi, the homework is simple: It has to understand where Dhaka's red lines on sovereignty, autonomy, and foreign policy now stand. Both nations face a more or less similar reality on the ground. Crises continue to pile up while populists promote their own versions of the Crime Master Gogo, the hilariously delusional villain from Bollywood's cult classic Andaz Apna Apna, convinced of his immense power while the world laughs. The time has come for veteran politicians to decide whether to continue this tragicomedy or accept that geography is destiny, and as such must be managed through restraint and reciprocity not out of affection, but rather cold pragmatism. I remain optimistic that politicians and diplomats will eventually stumble upon pragmatism at some point. Until then, someone should tell the spokespersons, partisan hype merchants, and assorted Crime Master Gogos that they are not helping. At all.

          "body": "When food carries the name of the land it comes from, it tells a story of soil, water, people, climate, history, and culture. In Bangladesh, this tale is beginning to take shape through the growing recognition of Geographical Indication (GI) foods, which legally certify the uniqueness of products tied to specific regions or districts. This offers new hope for farmers, fishermen, artisans, moiras (sweet makers), and local businesses. Yet, the hope is still fragile, slowly shaping itself into a brighter future. Bangladesh s GI products cover a wide range of food traditions, reflecting the cultural pride of each district. From fruits like Chapainawabganj s khirsapat mangoes, Rangpur s haribhanga mangoes or Narsingdi s lotkon, to field treasures such as Dinajpur s kataribhog rice or Sherpur s tulshimala rice, every item carries the story of local farmers and our seasons. The rivers and coast add their own signature through hilsa and bagda prawn, while sweetmeats such as Bogura s curd, Tangail s Porabari chamcham, or Natore s kachagolla continue to define regional identity. Together, these products show how deeply food is tied to place and our identity. However, the question arises as to how much of the potential has Bangladesh managed to unlock with these GI tags? What does GI recognition actually mean for the farmers, the fishermen, or the moiras? And how much of that spotlight truly reaches them? Dr Md Salauddin Palash, Professor, Department of Agribusiness and Marketing at Bangladesh Agricultural University, offered perhaps the most direct assessment: the market has not changed in any noticeable way. In theory, a GI product should transform a product s economic fate. It should guarantee authenticity, raise value, draw new buyers, and most importantly, open doors to the export market. In practice, the change is slower, quieter, and more complicated, Dr Palash explained. He pointed to the example of Jashore s date molasses, a beloved winter delicacy. Demand for this product is extremely high because of the country s large population, but production cannot keep up. As a result, adulteration sets in. Inferior products reach consumers, harming both public trust and producer reputation. In this chaos, the GI status loses the weight it should carry. His worry is not about the quality of the real producers, most of whom are still guarding their tradition with responsibility, but about the systems surrounding them. Without strong monitoring, quality control, and consumer awareness, the GI products sit beside a market full of impure products, whereas GI status is meant to ensure purity, he shared. Dr Palash highlighted that good-quality GI products certainly exist, but the people buying them are still a small group, mainly consumers with higher purchasing power who already know what to look for. Awareness is too low, he added. If general shoppers do not understand what makes a product special, they cannot be expected to value it differently. A GI product does not automatically increase income or reputation. It must be supported by strong systems, effective marketing, and public awareness. Dr Md Parvez Anwar, Professor, Department of Agronomy at Bangladesh Agricultural University, believes that the core power of GI lies in branding. Branding, he explained, does not generate overnight transformation. But it creates curiosity. And curiosity is what pulls a local speciality into national or even global conversation. Once people start asking about a food, searching for it online, or carrying it as a gift, its journey expands beyond its regional borders. According to him, GI products are gradually reaching the middle class, and that alone is a positive sign. Marketing efforts within media are improving slowly, and people from nearby districts are beginning to travel to source regions to taste or buy the products. For Dr Anwar, the future depends on two practical factors: awareness and availability. Many GI foods, like mangoes, curds, sweets, and fish, are highly perishable. Even if interest grows, buyers from distant districts cannot access the products without reliable cold storage, packaging, and distribution networks. He suggested establishing dedicated GI product chain shops across the country, where every item would come with verified quality and origin: an initiative he believes should be led by the government. Imagine walking into a single store where monda from Muktagacha, Sherpur s tulshimala rice or mangoes from Rajshahi division are available under proper branding and authentication. The value would increase instantly, he shared. He also shared another important perspective about the international market. Gaining international popularity is challenging, but far from impossible. Bengali communities live all over the world, creating a natural market for these products if they are promoted properly. Dr Anwar believes embassies can play a vital role by introducing GI items abroad through cultural events and food festivals that showcase the country s culinary heritage. With the right push, he feels these products can find recognition well beyond Bangladesh s borders. However, he also acknowledges the gaps, particularly in public understanding. A large portion of the population still does not know what GI means. Without TV, radio, or social media campaigns at the national level, the concept will remain misunderstood, he explained. To understand the human side of all this, Babul Chandra Mudok, proprietor of 120-year-old Goyanath Mistanno Bhandar in Netrokona, talked us through the emotions, struggles, and pride tied to their work. His family is the keeper of the district s iconic balish mishti, which recently received GI recognition. When asked how he felt the day balish mishti was granted GI status, Babul s answer was immediate: Akolponiyo (unimaginable). The entire district shared the joy. Wherever people from the district live, the news sparked a sense of pride. It s not just for our shop, it s a recognition for the whole district, he expressed. Yet, sales have not changed significantly. Babul admitted that customers still buy based on habit, taste, and occasion. He estimates that perhaps only 10 per cent of buyers actually understand GI. Still, he is proud of the legacy and proud of the recognition itself. According to him, there has been no structured monitoring, no financial support, and no follow-up guidance from authorities. This makes one thing clear: GI brings pride immediately, but economic benefits only come when systems follow. Stories of experts envisioning systems and producers holding on to tradition paint a clear picture of what GI foods could become for Bangladesh. The potential is enormous. A GI label creates exclusivity, and exclusivity can elevate price, demand, and export opportunities. Countries like India, Thailand, or Vietnam have successfully used GI branding as a national economic strategy. Bangladesh can follow a similar path, especially for mangoes, rice varieties, and fish. Dr Palash mentioned the possibility of canned fruits and fish that would preserve freshness and increase export shelf life, allowing Bangladeshi products to reach global supermarket shelves more effectively. Beyond economics, GI status safeguards cultural heritage. In a world shifting rapidly toward industrial food production, traditional methods and recipes often fade away. GI provides a protective shield for craftsmanship and regional pride. Without GI recognition, original recipes risk being overshadowed by commercial imitations; with GI recognition, the authenticity of a food becomes legally secured. GI foods also carry the potential to strengthen rural branding. Every GI product is essentially a story about a district: its people, landscapes, climate, history, and identity. A district known globally for its mangoes, sweets, or rice becomes more than a geographic location; it becomes a brand. This potential can attract tourists, stimulate local business, and deepen community pride. From discussions with agricultural experts and the sweet shop proprietor, one message was clear: for GI products to progress, awareness, credibility, and access must improve. Public understanding of GI needs to grow through media, campaigns, and education, while strict quality checks are essential to maintain public trust. Improved storage and distribution, along with dedicated GI retail spaces, can ensure verified products reach buyers. International promotion through embassies, trade fairs, and cultural events can open new markets. And, above all, producers require financial and technical support to preserve authenticity while expanding production. The journey of GI foods in Bangladesh is still in its early chapters. However, something profound has already begun. People are talking about origin, tradition, and authenticity, concepts that were rarely part of mainstream food discussions before. From scholars envisioning structured systems to artisans carrying century-old legacies, every voice signals the same belief: GI foods are not merely products. They embody the taste of the land. The journey is long, but the roots are strong. And in the intersection of land and culture, Bangladesh s GI foods hold a future waiting to be shaped. Photo: Sazzad Ibne Sayed",

          "body": "Bangladesh Bank (BB) has allowed a special loan rescheduling and restructuring facility for distressed export-oriented and domestic shipbuilding companies in a bid to keep the sector operational and improve loan recovery by banks. Under the facility, according to a central bank circular issued today, borrowers will have to make a 3 percent down payment on their outstanding loan balance to qualify for the facility. They must pay 1.5 percent at the time of application and the rest within the next six months. Defaulters will be able to reschedule or restructure their loans for up to 10 years, including a maximum two-year grace period, depending on the borrower s repayment capacity and business prospects, as per the circular. During the grace period, interest must be paid on a monthly or quarterly basis, while blocked interest will have to be repaid in instalments after the grace period ends, without additional interest. Borrowers must submit applications to their banks by June 30, 2026, along with the required down payment. Banks have been instructed to decide on applications within 60 days of receipt. The central bank has also instructed all scheduled banks to consider case-by-case applications from genuinely affected shipbuilders for special rescheduling of their classified loans as of December 31, 2025. For loans that were previously rescheduled under an earlier 2023 circular, banks may grant an additional two-year extension, subject to a further 2 percent down payment. The central bank said the move became necessary due to disruptions in global supply chains, geopolitical instability in Europe, and a global economic slowdown that hurt the cash flows of shipbuilders beyond their control. BB also clarified that firms found guilty of fraud, willful default, or loan manipulation will not be eligible for the facility. Before approving any rescheduling, banks must conduct a special inspection to verify whether the borrower was genuinely affected by circumstances beyond their control. Islamic banks have been asked to apply the same policy in line with Shariah principles. The circular takes immediate effect under Section 45 of the Bank Company Act, 1991. Bankers say the move could provide breathing space to the struggling shipbuilding sector, which has significant export potential but has faced financial stress in recent years due to global market volatility. At the end of 2024, total outstanding loans in the shipbuilding and ship-breaking industry stood at Tk 20,506 crore, of which Tk 8,031 crore had become defaulted, according to Bangladesh Bank data.",

          "body": "Prachyanat School of Acting and Design will present Mamunur Rashid s satirical play Guinea Pig tonight as the 49th batch s final production, capping six months of training in theatre craft at the Experimental Theatre Hall of Bangladesh Shilpakala Academy in Dhaka. The certificate ceremony and the performance begin at 6:30 pm. Veteran actress Dolly Zahur and Professor Yusuf Hassan Arko of Jahangirnagar University s drama department are expected as special guests. For 25 years, Prachyanat School has worked to expand theatre in Bangladesh and train a new generation of theatre practitioners, offering a six-month curriculum covering acting and the technical aspects of stagecraft. Forty-eight batches have completed the programme, and the 49th batch closes its term with this production. Written by acclaimed playwright, director and actor Mamunur Rashid, Guinea Pig is a sharp satire rooted in Bangladesh s socio-economic and political reality. The story exposes how ordinary people are treated like test subjects by the state apparatus and the affluent, highlighting deep disparities in how life and dignity are valued.At the centre of the play is Ahmed Ali, a senior government official representing a privileged class that retained influence after Bangladesh s independence, following the Pakistan era. His wife, Raziya, is absorbed in Rabindra Sangeet and social display, while their daughter Poppy represents a generation infatuated with modernity. The plot hinges on Poppy s pet guinea pig falling ill. As the household scrambles to secure expensive medicine for the animal, a parallel story unfolds of a hungry child in Keramat s family crying for milk that never arrives. The play lays bare a society in which the well-to-do assign greater importance to the life of a pet than to the health of a needy child. The stage production features a diverse ensemble, including Irina La Shafina, Arunito Bhor, Maria Akter Mridula, Sadman Nafis Kaderi, Graner Paul Dip Rozario, Sahadat Hossain, Fatima Tuz Johora Juthi, Afroze Maisha Jahan Alvy, Syeda Maisha Zahir, Arnab Roy Ankan, Ushaching Chowdhury, Sabuj Khan, Ashikul Islam Ashik and others. The performance is directed by Sakhawat Hossain Rezvi, with set and props planned by Swatee Bhadra, lighting and projection by Md Mukhlesur Rahman, music by AB Siddiqui, choreography by Diana Mereline Chowdhury and costume design by Jesmin Jahan Jhuma. Through its biting humour and allegory, Guinea Pig challenges audiences to confront the inequities that persist in society. Prachyanat School s decision to close its training cycle with such a piece underscores its commitment to theatre that interrogates social values and provokes reflection.",

          "body": "This is the opening instalment of a multi-part series on the Assam Bengal Line System: How land policies shaped modern Bangladesh. A region without hard edges Long before colonial officials drew lines across maps of Assam, Sylhet, and Bengal, the region lived by a different grammar of space. Rivers, forests, hills, and seasonal rhythms mattered far more than borders. People moved with floods, with harvests, with trade routes, and with political change. Identities were layered and situational village, occupation, language, faith rarely reduced to a single label. This matters because the Line System, introduced in the early 1920s, is often treated as a response to an age-old problem of migration. It was not. It was a solution invented for a problem the colonial state itself helped create. To understand how that happened, we must begin before British rule reshaped land, law, and belonging. This first article sets the ground beneath the later conflict. It shows that movement between Bengal and Assam was neither new nor inherently destabilising. What changed was not mobility itself, but the meaning attached to it. The geography that encouraged movement The eastern subcontinent is one of the most fluid ecological zones in the world. The Ganges Brahmaputra Meghna river system creates a constantly shifting landscape of floodplains, chars (river islands), wetlands, and forest clearings. Land appears and disappears within a generation. Fields are washed away; new soil emerges downstream. Survival has always required flexibility.In such an environment, movement was not an exception it was an adaptation. Peasant households relocated when rivers changed course. Fishing communities followed water. Cultivators expanded into newly deposited alluvial land. These movements did not register as migration in a modern sense; they were simply life within a deltaic world. Assam s Brahmaputra Valley, sparsely populated compared to Bengal s dense delta, was part of this shared ecological system. The river connected the two regions more than it divided them. Boats, not borders, shaped interaction. Pre-colonial Assam: Land, power, and flexibility Before British conquest, Assam was ruled for centuries by the Ahom kingdom. The Ahoms governed through a system that prioritised labour and allegiance rather than rigid territorial ownership. Land was abundant relative to population, and control over people mattered more than control over fixed plots. The paik system organised households into units responsible for state service military, agricultural, or artisanal. Rights to cultivate land were linked to participation in this system, not to permanent private ownership. Crucially, people could be absorbed into the polity over time. Ethnic and cultural boundaries were porous; groups assimilated through language, intermarriage, and service. This did not mean Assam was conflict-free. It did mean, however, that belonging was negotiated socially, not enforced bureaucratically. There was no concept of an outsider as a permanent legal category. Sylhet: A cultural bridge, not a borderland Sylhet occupies a special place in this history. Culturally and linguistically tied to Bengal, yet politically attached to Assam for long periods, Sylhet functioned as a bridge rather than a frontier. Trade routes connected Sylhet to the Brahmaputra Valley. Religious networks particularly Sufi shrines linked communities across regions. Seasonal labour moved back and forth. These connections normalised mobility and blurred distinctions between Assamese and Bengali long before those identities hardened. Later colonial decisions would turn Sylhet into a fault line. Before that, however, it exemplified coexistence through circulation rather than separation. Éva Rozália Hölzle, in her paper published in the Asian Journal of Social Science (Brill), The Formation of the Sylhet Meghalaya Assam Border , notes that the contemporary borderline between Sylhet, Meghalaya, and Assam gradually came into being as a result of long socio-political transformations (Ludden, 2003). During the Mughal era, Sylhet constituted the Empire s eastern frontier, while it served as the western frontier for the kingdoms of Assam. Nevertheless, there is no historical evidence that a definite Sylhet region (Ludden, 2003) existed prior to the Mughal conquest. The area included different territories of the Khasis, Garos, Bengali Hindus, and Muslims a population composition that characterises Sylhet even today (Ludden, 2003). The border between Meghalaya and Sylhet was a direct result of British expansion and the desire to impose stricter governance of population movements from the north, with the objective of protecting British imperial interests in Bengal (Ludden, 2003). The additional Assam Sylhet borderline was also the result of a longer socio-political transformation process between 1826 and 1947 (Chakrabarty, 2002). Bengal before the British: Abundance and adaptation Pre-colonial Bengal was one of the most agriculturally productive regions in the world. Its prosperity rested on wet-rice cultivation, artisanal production, and riverine trade. Yet abundance did not mean stability. Floods, crop failures, and political upheavals periodically displaced people. Importantly, these movements were absorbed within a flexible agrarian system. Land was cleared as the population grew; forests were converted into fields; new settlements formed on fresh alluvium. Mobility did not threaten social order it sustained it. This balance would be disrupted when colonial rule redefined land as a taxable commodity rather than a shared resource. How the British reframed land and people When the British East India Company gained revenue control over Bengal in the mid-18th century, it brought with it a radically different vision of land. Revenue had to be predictable. Ownership had to be legible. Populations had to be counted, classified, and fixed.This shift culminated in policies such as the Permanent Settlement, which transformed land into private property and tied revenue demands to it. Over time, this created land scarcity, indebtedness, and displacement especially in the densely populated districts of eastern Bengal. At the same time, regions such as Assam were increasingly viewed through an extractive lens. Forests became resources; uncultivated land became waste. The stage was set for a new logic: moving people to maximise revenue. Crucially, the colonial state began to see mobility not as normal, but as something to be managed. Census, categories, and the birth of anxiety One of the most consequential colonial innovations was the census. Beginning in the late 19th century, the British attempted to classify every individual by religion, language, and ethnicity.These categories froze identities that had once been fluid. They also made demographic change visible and therefore political. When numbers shifted, alarm followed. Before this, no authority had asked how many people spoke which language in a district, or what proportion followed which faith. Once these questions were institutionalised, population itself became a source of fear. This marks a critical turning point. Migration did not suddenly increase because of inherent cultural traits; it became controversial because it became countable. Rethinking indigenous and migrant In the pre-colonial world, these categories had little meaning. A family that settled, cultivated, paid dues, and integrated over time became part of the local order. Colonial rule reversed this logic. Belonging began to depend on origin rather than participation. Time ceased to soften difference. Instead, it hardened it. This redefinition would later underpin the Line System, which attempted to spatially separate people based on where they were assumed to come from regardless of how long they had lived there. Land, authority, and belonging in the pre-colonial order To understand why mobility was not inherently destabilising before British rule, it is necessary to look more closely at how land and authority functioned in both Bengal and Assam prior to colonial intervention. As historians such as Ranajit Guha have shown in A Rule of Property for Bengal, pre-colonial agrarian systems did not treat land as a fully alienable commodity in the modern sense. Rights over land were layered, overlapping, and often conditional, tied to cultivation, tribute, and political loyalty rather than absolute ownership. Further, the work provides an intellectual history of the Permanent Settlement of Bengal (1793), showing that it was not an inevitable administrative choice but the product of an eighteenth-century European intellectual genealogy, particularly physiocratic thought, adapted to Bengal s agrarian context. British policymakers, influenced by thinkers such as Alexander Dow, Henry Pattullo, and Philip Francis, aimed to create secure property rights to incentivise agricultural improvement. Yet, when these ideas were transposed onto Bengal s pre-colonial, flexible land and revenue systems, they produced an epistemological paradox . Rather than fostering capitalist agriculture, these policies reinforced neo-feudal land relations, embedded pre-capitalist social hierarchies within colonial governance, and demonstrated how colonial policy operated as both knowledge production and statecraft translating abstract European theories into concrete legal, fiscal, and social structures that reshaped land, authority, and belonging in ways that often contradicted their intended effects. The British intended the Permanent Settlement to create capitalist farming and secure revenue, but instead it reinforced landlord power and limited peasants rights. In Mughal Bengal, sovereignty rested on the ability to extract revenue, not on enforcing fixed village boundaries or exclusive property titles. Peasants cultivated land under a variety of tenurial arrangements, and new cultivation was actively encouraged as forests were cleared and wetlands reclaimed. Richard Eaton s work on the eastern Bengal frontier, in his book The Rise of Islam and the Bengal Frontier, demonstrates that agricultural expansion was a centuries-long process, driven by riverine ecology and state encouragement rather than sudden population explosions. Movement into new lands was therefore understood as productive, even desirable. Early environmental and agrarian foundations (2nd millennium B.C. 5th century B.C.) The Bengal delta, a flat, low-lying floodplain shaped by the Ganges, Brahmaputra, and Meghna rivers, has been built up over millennia. Rivers served as transport routes and defined cultural subregions: Varendra, Bhagirathi Hooghly, Vanga, Samatata, and Harikela. Human settlement dates back to the second millennium B.C., with tribes such as the Pundra, Rad ha, Suhma, and Vanga lending their names to regions. Archaeological evidence shows rice cultivation, systematic housing, cemeteries, and copper ornaments. Early agriculture involved shifting cultivation, using stone tools for rice and millet farming. Proto-Munda speakers may have pioneered these systems around 1500 B.C. By the sixth fifth centuries B.C., the middle Gangetic Plain had shifted to permanent wet-rice farming, requiring communal labour, irrigation, and improved tools such as iron axes and ploughshares, marking the transition to advanced rice agriculture and laying the foundation for Bengal s agrarian society. Fourteenth fifteenth centuries: Forest clearing, pīrs, and agrarian expansion From the fourteenth century onward, the expansion of cultivation in Bengal s forested frontiers became closely linked to charismatic Muslim holy men (pīrs), who were remembered not only as spiritual authorities but also as organisers of agrarian settlement. Oral traditions, gazetteers, and literary works such as Mukundaram s Can d ī-Man gala and the Sekaśubhodayā depict them guiding large local and migrant populations in clearing jungle, embanking land, digging tanks, establishing wet-rice cultivation, building mosques, and founding villages, often with state backing. In this way, religious charisma, agrarian expansion, and the institutionalisation of Islam became mutually reinforcing and eventually produced a rural religious gentry . A closely related narrative surrounds Khan Jahan (d. 1459), the patron saint of Bagerhat on the edge of the Sundarbans, whose tomb inscription names him Ulugh Khan-i Azam Khan Jahan, indicating a Turkic origin and high rank in the Bengal sultanate. Nineteenth-century traditions credit him with reclaiming forested waste for rice cultivation, converting local populations, and constructing roads and mosques after receiving a jagir from the ruler of Gaur. His large-scale works imply control over revenue and labour as a major zamindar, before he ultimately withdrew from worldly authority to live as a faqir. Sixteenth-century literary reflections and agrarian epic Mukundaram s poem can thus be read as a grand epic dramatising the process of civilisation-building in the Bengal delta, and specifically the push of agrarian civilisation into formerly forested lands. It is true that the model of royal authority that informed Mukundaram s work is unambiguously Hindu. The king, Kalaketu, was both a devotee of the forest goddess Chandi and a Hindu raja in the medieval (that is, post-eighth-century) sense, while the peasant cultivators in the poem showed their allegiance to the king by accepting betel nut from his mouth an act drawing directly on the common Hindu ritual expressing devotion to a deity, the pūjā ceremony. Yet it was Muslims who were the principal pioneers responsible for clearing the forest, making it possible for both the city and its rice fields to flourish. The Great Hero Kalaketu is clearing the forest, wrote the poet: Hearing the news, outsiders came from various lands.The Hero then bought and distributed among themHeavy knives kāt h-dā , axes kut hār , battle-axes t āngī , and pikes bān .From the north came the Das (people),One hundred of them advanced.They were struck with wonder on seeing the Hero,Who distributed betel nut to each of them.From the south came the harvesters,Five hundred of them under one organiser.From the west came Zafar Mian,Together with twenty-two thousand men.Sulaimani beads in their hands,They chanted the names of their pīr and the Prophet pegambar .Having cleared the forest,They established markets.Hundreds and hundreds of foreignersAte and entered the forest.Hearing the sound of the axe,Tigers became apprehensive and ran away, roaring. Late sixteenth early seventeenth century European accounts of Bengal s agrarian abundance In 1567, Cesare Federici judged Sandwip to be the fertilest land in all the world, and recorded that one could obtain there a sack of fine rice for a thing of nothing. Twenty years later, when Isa Khan still held sway over Sonargaon, Ralph Fitch wrote: Great store of Cotton doth goeth from hence, and much Rice, wherewith they serve all India, Ceilon, Pegu, Malacca, Sumatra, and many other places. The most impressive evidence in this regard comes from François Pyrard. After spending the spring of 1607 in Chittagong, still under independent rulers beyond the Mughals grasp, the Frenchman wrote: There is such a quantity of rice that, besides supplying the whole country, it is exported to all parts of India, as well to Goa and Malabar as to Sumatra, the Moluccas, and all the islands of Sunda, to all of which lands Bengal is a very nursing mother, who supplies them with their entire subsistence and food. Thus, one sees arrive there i.e., Chittagong every day an infinite number of vessels from all parts of India for these provisions.

Seventeenth century: Mughal state and the agrarian order From the reign of Akbar onward, the Mughals sought to integrate Indians into their political system at two levels. At the elite level, they endeavoured to absorb both Muslim and non-Muslim chieftains into imperial service, thereby transforming potential state enemies into loyal servants. They also sought to expand the empire s agrarian base, and hence its wealth, by transforming forest lands into arable fields and the semi-nomadic forest-dwelling peoples inhabiting those lands into settled farmers. From the time of Shah Jahan 1627 58 , records an eighteenth-century revenue document, it was customary that wood-cutters and plough-men used to accompany his troops, so that forests might be cleared and land cultivated. Ploughs used to be donated by the government. Short-term pattas were given, with fixed government demand at the rate of one anna per bigha during the first year. Chaudhuris were appointed to keep the ri aya happy with their considerate behaviour and to populate the country. There was a general order that whosoever cleared a forest and brought land under cultivation, such land would be his zamindari. An undated order by Aurangzeb (1658 1707) reveals a similar concern with increasing arable acreage, adding that should any peasant flee the land, the local revenue officers should ascertain the cause and work very hard to induce him to return to his former place. Such an appeal hardly suggests a state bargaining from a position of strength. In fact, it points to the chronic surplus of land over labour that obtained in premodern India generally, and in Bengal until as late as the mid-nineteenth century. In the settled western and north-western parts of Bengal, Mughal officials collected land tax from the Hindu peasantry at full rates through Kayasthas and other zamīndārs. In the less cultivated eastern and southern regions, the government encouraged the establishment of new agrarian colonies, often led by individuals with local religious influence, as they were seen as connected to stable, reliable institutions. Assam followed a different political trajectory but shared a similar flexibility. As J. N. Sarkar documents in History of Assam, Ahom rulers measured strength through manpower and service obligations, not cadastral precision. When populations shifted through warfare, environmental change, or economic opportunity the state adapted by absorbing newcomers rather than excluding them. What mattered was incorporation into the labour and tribute system, not ancestry or place of origin. Crucially, none of these systems required a sharp distinction between indigenous and migrant as fixed identities. The idea that a person s legitimacy depended on where their ancestors had lived was largely absent. Belonging was produced over time through cultivation, contribution, and coexistence. In India Against Itself: Assam and the Politics of Nationality, Sanjib Baruah emphasises that the Bengal Assam region functioned as a fluid world long before colonial intervention, where rivers, forests, and seasonal rhythms guided movement more than political boundaries. Trade, labour, and cultivation flowed across landscapes naturally, and communities absorbed newcomers without rigid distinctions. Under Ahom rule, land was tied to service and allegiance through the paik system rather than fixed ownership, and belonging was produced over time through participation, cultivation, and social incorporation rather than ancestry. Seasonal labour, agrarian expansion, and cross-regional movement were therefore normal and stabilising, not disruptive, highlighting that colonial anxieties about migration emerged only when the state imposed classification, enumeration, and rigid legal categories on previously flexible social and ecological systems. This historical reality complicates later colonial claims that migration into Assam represented an unprecedented rupture. As Amalendu Guha notes in Planter Raj to Swaraj, the anxiety surrounding Bengali settlement in Assam emerged not because movement was new, but because colonial capitalism altered the scale, speed, and visibility of demographic change while simultaneously narrowing the criteria for belonging. In contrast to the agrarian expansion and cultural assimilation observed in premodern Bengal, Assam under the Planter Raj illustrates the limits of colonial modernisation. The introduction of plantation agriculture and a market-oriented economy could not effect a radical transformation of local society. Urbanisation remained negligible, and the emerging Assamese middle class was small, weak, and unconsolidated. Most inputs for the modern sector capital, enterprise, and labour came from outside the province, leaving local peasant economies only tenuously connected. In this plural, multi-sectoral economy, tribalism and feudal remnants persisted alongside promising capitalist relations, stifling the early development of political consciousness. Yet the peasantry, burdened by land revenue and new taxes, maintained a quiet but persistent resistance to colonial authority. Over time, the middle class began to recognise imperialism as the root of social and economic grievances, gradually engaging with electoral politics and aligning with broader freedom movements though this process was slow and mediated by the constraints of colonial structures. Why this history matters This history matters because it reminds us that mobility between Bengal and Assam is not an aberration or a modern crisis, but a long-standing social reality shaped by rivers, trade, cultivation, and shared livelihoods rather than by borders. Before colonial rule, people moved to farm land, follow watercourses, trade goods, and build communities in ways that made sense locally, without rigid ideas of territory or fixed identities. Recovering these pasts challenges present-day narratives that treat movement as intrusion and populations as outsiders. It shows that today s anxieties are rooted not in ancient hostilities, but in relatively recent policies that imposed lines on a landscape that had long functioned through connection, circulation, and coexistence.

          "body": "Prachyanat School of Acting and Design will present Mamunur Rashid s satirical play Guinea Pig tonight as the 49th batch s final production, capping six months of training in theatre craft at the Experimental Theatre Hall of Bangladesh Shilpakala Academy in Dhaka. The certificate ceremony and the performance begin at 6:30 pm. Veteran actress Dolly Zahur and Professor Yusuf Hassan Arko of Jahangirnagar University s drama department are expected as special guests. For 25 years, Prachyanat School has worked to expand theatre in Bangladesh and train a new generation of theatre practitioners, offering a six-month curriculum covering acting and the technical aspects of stagecraft. Forty-eight batches have completed the programme, and the 49th batch closes its term with this production. Written by acclaimed playwright, director and actor Mamunur Rashid, Guinea Pig is a sharp satire rooted in Bangladesh s socio-economic and political reality. The story exposes how ordinary people are treated like test subjects by the state apparatus and the affluent, highlighting deep disparities in how life and dignity are valued.At the centre of the play is Ahmed Ali, a senior government official representing a privileged class that retained influence after Bangladesh s independence, following the Pakistan era. His wife, Raziya, is absorbed in Rabindra Sangeet and social display, while their daughter Poppy represents a generation infatuated with modernity. The plot hinges on Poppy s pet guinea pig falling ill. As the household scrambles to secure expensive medicine for the animal, a parallel story unfolds of a hungry child in Keramat s family crying for milk that never arrives. The play lays bare a society in which the well-to-do assign greater importance to the life of a pet than to the health of a needy child. The stage production features a diverse ensemble, including Irina La Shafina, Arunito Bhor, Maria Akter Mridula, Sadman Nafis Kaderi, Graner Paul Dip Rozario, Sahadat Hossain, Fatima Tuz Johora Juthi, Afroze Maisha Jahan Alvy, Syeda Maisha Zahir, Arnab Roy Ankan, Ushaching Chowdhury, Sabuj Khan, Ashikul Islam Ashik and others. The performance is directed by Sakhawat Hossain Rezvi, with set and props planned by Swatee Bhadra, lighting and projection by Md Mukhlesur Rahman, music by AB Siddiqui, choreography by Diana Mereline Chowdhury and costume design by Jesmin Jahan Jhuma. Through its biting humour and allegory, Guinea Pig challenges audiences to confront the inequities that persist in society. Prachyanat School s decision to close its training cycle with such a piece underscores its commitment to theatre that interrogates social values and provokes reflection.",

He will be discharged from the National Institute of Burn and Plastic Surgery as the 36th and last patient to leave the facility. Abidur, a student of the school, had suffered 22 percent burns. At least 36 people, including 28 students and three teachers, were killed when an Air Force training aircraft plunged into the school premises on July 21 last year. Following the accident, a total of 57 injured students, teachers and staff were admitted to the burn institute. Of them, 20 later died, one was transferred to the National Institute of Mental Health, and 35 others were discharged at different times after treatment. With Abidur s release, all surviving patients admitted to the burn institute after the accident will have returned home, Prof Nasir Uddin, director of the institute, told The Daily Star today. Abidur also had several other complications but is now fit to be released, Prof Nasir said.",

          "title": "Minimalism took over but was it worth losing colour?",
          "body": "What lies behind the idea that the world is losing colours? Is the world truly losing its colours? These questions may almost feel poetic, but beyond poetry echoes a cultural truth; we are quietly, collectively draining colour out of our lives. This loss of colours did not happen overnight it is the result of a bunch of decades of shifting tastes, technologies, and psychological influences that have slowly guided us away from the world our predecessors knew. Over the past few years, almost every corner of our lives has quietly shifted toward a muted sameness. Homes have opted for beige rooms and minimalist furniture that promise calm but often feel identical. Even our cityscapes have dulled. Building exteriors are wrapped in cement-grey blocks and glass, monochrome steel, and matte modernism. Our wardrobes reflect the same transformation. Today, neutrals dominate closets across the world, shaped by the rise of safe fashion on social media. As people are more cautious economically and environmentally, they choose clothes that are reusable, multifunctional, and timeless. Weddings, once vibrant explosions of reds, marigolds, emeralds, and intricate motifs, are now gradually adopting Western-influenced pastel palettes. The most visible changes are our streets. Cars now move almost uniformly in shades of white, black, and silver, turning streets even more monochrome. Even cafes and restaurants have succumbed by monotone interiors, concrete walls, and warm lighting, designed purely for social media aesthetics. Technology intensified this shift. Digital screens favour soft tones that reduce eye strain, gradually training our preferences toward desaturated palettes in real life. Branding and product design followed suit; logos lost colour, packaging became simpler, and public spaces leaned into greys and metallics. From within to beyond, from personal to public, the world s visual identity has inaudibly drifted toward uniform neutrality. And so, it seems true to say the world lost its hue. In the early 1900s, colour was a language of excitement and modernity. In the decades between the 1920s and the 1970s, colour enjoyed a golden age. Everyday life looked like a festival of shades. From the 1900s to today, a decline in colour usage is clearly visible across industries. Researchers call this shift Colour Depletion or Chromatic Decline. Between the '20s to '50s, society embraced vibrant hues everywhere. After World War II, the world entered a wave of vibrancy. Cars, posters, fashion, and interiors showcased bright and cheerful colours, reflecting post-war optimism. Post '50s bought maximal colour to its peak as synthetic dyes became cheap and growing economies encouraged expressive consumption. By the '80s and '90s, subtle shifts began. Though the '80s still celebrated neon and pop cultural vibrance, the influence of early digital technology introduced a preference for limited, stable colour palettes. The 2000s marked a decisive shift in how we experienced colour and design. It may not have stolen all the saturation, but gently set the tone for a more muted era. From 2010s onwards, the world entered the era of saturation disappearance. Minimalism became not just a design philosophy but a lifestyle statement. Walk into a house before the wave of minimalism and you re greeted with walls in cheerful shades of spring green, mustard yellow, or candy pink, kitchens alive with turquoise cabinets. Beds were draped in big, bold bedsheets in reds, yellows, greens, and blues, often patterned with sprawling florals. Sofas had cushions in stripes, checks, or vibrant floral prints, sometimes matching patterned mattresses. Curtains swung with intricate all-over designs or floral motifs, and rugs layered the floors in bright, cheerful patterns that brought the room alive. Fashion too, was fearless. Men in patterned shirts, women in vivid sarees, scarves and bangles in every hue imaginable. Even the streets reflected vividness. Cars in cherry red, mint green, sunflower yellow, or sky blue lined the roads, and public buildings featured colourful frontages and tiled exteriors. Culture is never one directional. Every trend creates its own rebellion. Generation Z is already experimenting with maximalist decor, retro graphics, and vivid wardrobes. The fading mirrors who we are, digitally tired, socially exposed, economically cautious and environmentally aware. Minimalism gave us calmness, but monotony may soon exhaust us. So, the pendulum may swing again from pale minimalism to bold expression.",

          "body": "Dhaka Metropolitan Police (DMP) has announced strict legal action, including fines and imprisonment, against honking in the Hazrat Shahjalal International Airport area, Gulshan, Banani, Baridhara, and Niketan starting January 25. Honking in these designated areas could lead to a maximum fine of Tk 10,000 or up to three months in jail, said a public notice signed by DMP Commissioner SM Sazzat Ali today. According to the notice, Hazrat Shahjalal International Airport area and the road stretching one and a half kilometres north-south of the airport (from Scholastica School to Hotel Le Méridien) had been declared a \"silent zone\" in September last year. Gulshan, Banani, Baridhara, and Niketan are also included under this designation. Under the Sound Pollution (Control) Rules, 2006, honking in these areas is a punishable offence. From January 25, the DMP Traffic Division will enforce penalties against vehicles violating the rule, particularly on roads and parking areas under the Civil Aviation Authority. Additionally, special mobile courts will be conducted in the presence of magistrates from the Department of Environment, BRTA, Civil Aviation, Dhaka North City Corporation, and DMP to impose fines or imprisonment. When asked why the implementation is being emphasised now despite the declaration being made in September last year, DMP Deputy Commissioner (Media) Talebur Rahman told The Daily Star, Police will strictly enforce this law from January 25. Violators will be brought to book.\"",

          "body": "Bangladesh Bank (BB) has allowed a special loan rescheduling and restructuring facility for distressed export-oriented and domestic shipbuilding companies in a bid to keep the sector operational and improve loan recovery by banks. Under the facility, according to a central bank circular issued today, borrowers will have to make a 3 percent down payment on their outstanding loan balance to qualify for the facility. They must pay 1.5 percent at the time of application and the rest within the next six months. Defaulters will be able to reschedule or restructure their loans for up to 10 years, including a maximum two-year grace period, depending on the borrower s repayment capacity and business prospects, as per the circular. During the grace period, interest must be paid on a monthly or quarterly basis, while blocked interest will have to be repaid in instalments after the grace period ends, without additional interest. Borrowers must submit applications to their banks by June 30, 2026, along with the required down payment. Banks have been instructed to decide on applications within 60 days of receipt. The central bank has also instructed all scheduled banks to consider case-by-case applications from genuinely affected shipbuilders for special rescheduling of their classified loans as of December 31, 2025. For loans that were previously rescheduled under an earlier 2023 circular, banks may grant an additional two-year extension, subject to a further 2 percent down payment. The central bank said the move became necessary due to disruptions in global supply chains, geopolitical instability in Europe, and a global economic slowdown that hurt the cash flows of shipbuilders beyond their control. BB also clarified that firms found guilty of fraud, willful default, or loan manipulation will not be eligible for the facility. Before approving any rescheduling, banks must conduct a special inspection to verify whether the borrower was genuinely affected by circumstances beyond their control. Islamic banks have been asked to apply the same policy in line with Shariah principles. The circular takes immediate effect under Section 45 of the Bank Company Act, 1991. Bankers say the move could provide breathing space to the struggling shipbuilding sector, which has significant export potential but has faced financial stress in recent years due to global market volatility. At the end of 2024, total outstanding loans in the shipbuilding and ship-breaking industry stood at Tk 20,506 crore, of which Tk 8,031 crore had become defaulted, according to Bangladesh Bank data.",

          "title": "Leather and footwear: The next big export frontier for Bangladesh",
          "body": "When Bangladesh s export story is mentioned, garments usually dominate the headline. Yet beneath that louder narrative, another sector has been steadily gaining international attention. The leather and footwear industry, once known mainly for exporting raw hide, is now quietly positioning itself as one of Bangladesh s most promising export frontiers. Industry insiders say the shift is real, and it is evident in the stories of those who left comfortable lives abroad to return and build something from scratch. As of 2025, the industry is ranked among the top global players. Bangladesh is the 18th largest exporter in the global footwear market. Last fiscal year (FY2024-25) saw a surge in footwear exports, and earnings rose more than 34 per cent. Numbers rarely lie. They point to a sector that is waking up properly, not by accident, but because the ingredients are finally starting to align. However, statistics alone do not capture why this sector feels different now. You understand it better when you hear someone like Sara Hossain speak. Md Saddam Hossain, Quality Assurance Officer, Craftsman Hossain is the Corporate Director of Craftsman Footwear and Accessories, someone who had every reason to stay in Canada after living there for 18 years. A stable job, a predictable life, a child settled in school a routine that worked without friction. Yet, none of it felt like it was building anything. When her father floated the idea of a shoe factory, she hesitated. But took the chance. She arrived knowing nothing about making shoes. She learnt by walking the factory floor with her father and realising how many hands touch one pair before it reaches a shelf. We have no idea how many people are involved in making just a pair of shoes. There is so much that goes into making them comfortable and look good, she says. Her creativity found a home in this repetitive craft. She also noticed almost immediately that Bangladeshis are incredibly trend-sensitive. Yet, the local shelves still look the same. Designing for a market that wants variety but has very few people producing it felt like a chance worth fighting for. As she observed, People follow global trends, but locally we still see the same designs in stores. That sense of possibility is one of Bangladesh s biggest advantages. Labour costs remain competitive. Raw materials are available at home. Buyers from Europe and North America are already watching because the pricing and quality have improved. The government recognises the sector as a priority for investment under the Bangladesh Investment Development Authority (BIDA) and has created incentives to support it. Still, the road is anything but smooth. There are deep challenges the country must acknowledge. Many tanneries and leather units operate far below capacity. The export basket is still too heavy on raw hides and semi-processed products that earn little compared to finished shoes and bags. Countries like China, Vietnam and India capture the markets Bangladesh aims for because they mastered finishing, branding and consistency long ago. Skill shortages remain a major bottleneck. The number of actual designers is low. Many who claim the title are technicians or hobbyists. When I am hiring someone whom I call a designer, he is not actually a designer, Hossain said. He is basically a technician or maybe a student out of passion. Financing is another hurdle. Entrepreneurs struggle with collateral demands, high interest rates, and banks that treat the sector as high risk. Foreign investment remains far below potential. Buyers abroad still associate Bangladesh with raw leather, not luxury finishing, which creates a credibility gap. Even when manufacturers want to scale, the supply chain slows them down. Without proper backend finishing capabilities, much of the leather has to be sent to China for processing and then bought back at a higher price. That adds delays and uncertainty. Local inspection is often impossible when shipments come from abroad, leaving room for inconsistency. I have to buy my own leather at a higher price after it goes to China and comes back, Hossain said. Despite this, people like Sara Hossain remain in the trade. Their factories employ hundreds. Her reflections on Bangladesh s chaos are painfully relatable. She does not thrive in it. She developed routines to survive it. Good shoes, she says, are defined by comfort, quality and proportion. If you forget you are wearing them after a day at the office, then they have done their job. The process is long and meticulous. A single pair takes around two to three hours. Some things remain proudly manual, such as finishing touches, hand-painted areas, and details that machines cannot replicate. Even with machinery, the final eye must be human. In her factory, it is still about 60 per cent manual and 40 per cent automated. Handmade things have their own finishing, and that s the uniqueness, she said. Hossain believes Bangladesh has not yet formed its own design language but is slowly getting there. She builds collections with trends in mind but adjusts for weather, local habits, and the demographic she is serving. Comfort testing happens in multiple rounds, and she relies on real users to point out issues. Sourcing remains largely local at around ninety per cent, but limitations in processing force her to rely on other countries for the rest. Exporting is difficult because buyers want premium finishing but do not want to pay a premium price. Logistics issues and port delays add another layer of frustration. Her vision for the future is simple but ambitious. Sara Hossain wants people to pick up local products and recognise the value without comparing them to foreign brands first. She wants longevity and sustainability to matter. Under the right conditions with investment, policy support and infrastructure, Bangladesh s leather and footwear sector can become a major growth driver. It already has the labour, the demand, the raw materials and the ambition. What it needs now is a cleaner system, better financing, improved compliance and a national commitment to value-added production. The foundation is here. The momentum is real. The question now is whether Bangladesh is willing to step fully into a future it has already begun building. Photo: Shourav Kabir Location: Craftsman Footwear Accessories",

          "body": "When food carries the name of the land it comes from, it tells a story of soil, water, people, climate, history, and culture. In Bangladesh, this tale is beginning to take shape through the growing recognition of Geographical Indication (GI) foods, which legally certify the uniqueness of products tied to specific regions or districts. This offers new hope for farmers, fishermen, artisans, moiras (sweet makers), and local businesses. Yet, the hope is still fragile, slowly shaping itself into a brighter future. Bangladesh s GI products cover a wide range of food traditions, reflecting the cultural pride of each district. From fruits like Chapainawabganj s khirsapat mangoes, Rangpur s haribhanga mangoes or Narsingdi s lotkon, to field treasures such as Dinajpur s kataribhog rice or Sherpur s tulshimala rice, every item carries the story of local farmers and our seasons. The rivers and coast add their own signature through hilsa and bagda prawn, while sweetmeats such as Bogura s curd, Tangail s Porabari chamcham, or Natore s kachagolla continue to define regional identity. Together, these products show how deeply food is tied to place and our identity. However, the question arises as to how much of the potential has Bangladesh managed to unlock with these GI tags? What does GI recognition actually mean for the farmers, the fishermen, or the moiras? And how much of that spotlight truly reaches them? Dr Md Salauddin Palash, Professor, Department of Agribusiness and Marketing at Bangladesh Agricultural University, offered perhaps the most direct assessment: the market has not changed in any noticeable way. In theory, a GI product should transform a product s economic fate. It should guarantee authenticity, raise value, draw new buyers, and most importantly, open doors to the export market. In practice, the change is slower, quieter, and more complicated, Dr Palash explained. He pointed to the example of Jashore s date molasses, a beloved winter delicacy. Demand for this product is extremely high because of the country s large population, but production cannot keep up. As a result, adulteration sets in. Inferior products reach consumers, harming both public trust and producer reputation. In this chaos, the GI status loses the weight it should carry. His worry is not about the quality of the real producers, most of whom are still guarding their tradition with responsibility, but about the systems surrounding them. Without strong monitoring, quality control, and consumer awareness, the GI products sit beside a market full of impure products, whereas GI status is meant to ensure purity, he shared. Dr Palash highlighted that good-quality GI products certainly exist, but the people buying them are still a small group, mainly consumers with higher purchasing power who already know what to look for. Awareness is too low, he added. If general shoppers do not understand what makes a product special, they cannot be expected to value it differently. A GI product does not automatically increase income or reputation. It must be supported by strong systems, effective marketing, and public awareness. Dr Md Parvez Anwar, Professor, Department of Agronomy at Bangladesh Agricultural University, believes that the core power of GI lies in branding. Branding, he explained, does not generate overnight transformation. But it creates curiosity. And curiosity is what pulls a local speciality into national or even global conversation. Once people start asking about a food, searching for it online, or carrying it as a gift, its journey expands beyond its regional borders. According to him, GI products are gradually reaching the middle class, and that alone is a positive sign. Marketing efforts within media are improving slowly, and people from nearby districts are beginning to travel to source regions to taste or buy the products. For Dr Anwar, the future depends on two practical factors: awareness and availability. Many GI foods, like mangoes, curds, sweets, and fish, are highly perishable. Even if interest grows, buyers from distant districts cannot access the products without reliable cold storage, packaging, and distribution networks. He suggested establishing dedicated GI product chain shops across the country, where every item would come with verified quality and origin: an initiative he believes should be led by the government. Imagine walking into a single store where monda from Muktagacha, Sherpur s tulshimala rice or mangoes from Rajshahi division are available under proper branding and authentication. The value would increase instantly, he shared. He also shared another important perspective about the international market. Gaining international popularity is challenging, but far from impossible. Bengali communities live all over the world, creating a natural market for these products if they are promoted properly. Dr Anwar believes embassies can play a vital role by introducing GI items abroad through cultural events and food festivals that showcase the country s culinary heritage. With the right push, he feels these products can find recognition well beyond Bangladesh s borders. However, he also acknowledges the gaps, particularly in public understanding. A large portion of the population still does not know what GI means. Without TV, radio, or social media campaigns at the national level, the concept will remain misunderstood, he explained. To understand the human side of all this, Babul Chandra Mudok, proprietor of 120-year-old Goyanath Mistanno Bhandar in Netrokona, talked us through the emotions, struggles, and pride tied to their work. His family is the keeper of the district s iconic balish mishti, which recently received GI recognition. When asked how he felt the day balish mishti was granted GI status, Babul s answer was immediate: Akolponiyo (unimaginable). The entire district shared the joy. Wherever people from the district live, the news sparked a sense of pride. It s not just for our shop, it s a recognition for the whole district, he expressed. Yet, sales have not changed significantly. Babul admitted that customers still buy based on habit, taste, and occasion. He estimates that perhaps only 10 per cent of buyers actually understand GI. Still, he is proud of the legacy and proud of the recognition itself. According to him, there has been no structured monitoring, no financial support, and no follow-up guidance from authorities. This makes one thing clear: GI brings pride immediately, but economic benefits only come when systems follow. Stories of experts envisioning systems and producers holding on to tradition paint a clear picture of what GI foods could become for Bangladesh. The potential is enormous. A GI label creates exclusivity, and exclusivity can elevate price, demand, and export opportunities. Countries like India, Thailand, or Vietnam have successfully used GI branding as a national economic strategy. Bangladesh can follow a similar path, especially for mangoes, rice varieties, and fish. Dr Palash mentioned the possibility of canned fruits and fish that would preserve freshness and increase export shelf life, allowing Bangladeshi products to reach global supermarket shelves more effectively. Beyond economics, GI status safeguards cultural heritage. In a world shifting rapidly toward industrial food production, traditional methods and recipes often fade away. GI provides a protective shield for craftsmanship and regional pride. Without GI recognition, original recipes risk being overshadowed by commercial imitations; with GI recognition, the authenticity of a food becomes legally secured. GI foods also carry the potential to strengthen rural branding. Every GI product is essentially a story about a district: its people, landscapes, climate, history, and identity. A district known globally for its mangoes, sweets, or rice becomes more than a geographic location; it becomes a brand. This potential can attract tourists, stimulate local business, and deepen community pride. From discussions with agricultural experts and the sweet shop proprietor, one message was clear: for GI products to progress, awareness, credibility, and access must improve. Public understanding of GI needs to grow through media, campaigns, and education, while strict quality checks are essential to maintain public trust. Improved storage and distribution, along with dedicated GI retail spaces, can ensure verified products reach buyers. International promotion through embassies, trade fairs, and cultural events can open new markets. And, above all, producers require financial and technical support to preserve authenticity while expanding production. The journey of GI foods in Bangladesh is still in its early chapters. However, something profound has already begun. People are talking about origin, tradition, and authenticity, concepts that were rarely part of mainstream food discussions before. From scholars envisioning structured systems to artisans carrying century-old legacies, every voice signals the same belief: GI foods are not merely products. They embody the taste of the land. The journey is long, but the roots are strong. And in the intersection of land and culture, Bangladesh s GI foods hold a future waiting to be shaped. Photo: Sazzad Ibne Sayed",

          "body": "Dhaka Metropolitan Police (DMP) has announced strict legal action, including fines and imprisonment, against honking in the Hazrat Shahjalal International Airport area, Gulshan, Banani, Baridhara, and Niketan starting January 25. Honking in these designated areas could lead to a maximum fine of Tk 10,000 or up to three months in jail, said a public notice signed by DMP Commissioner SM Sazzat Ali today. According to the notice, Hazrat Shahjalal International Airport area and the road stretching one and a half kilometres north-south of the airport (from Scholastica School to Hotel Le Méridien) had been declared a \"silent zone\" in September last year. Gulshan, Banani, Baridhara, and Niketan are also included under this designation. Under the Sound Pollution (Control) Rules, 2006, honking in these areas is a punishable offence. From January 25, the DMP Traffic Division will enforce penalties against vehicles violating the rule, particularly on roads and parking areas under the Civil Aviation Authority. Additionally, special mobile courts will be conducted in the presence of magistrates from the Department of Environment, BRTA, Civil Aviation, Dhaka North City Corporation, and DMP to impose fines or imprisonment. When asked why the implementation is being emphasised now despite the declaration being made in September last year, DMP Deputy Commissioner (Media) Talebur Rahman told The Daily Star, Police will strictly enforce this law from January 25. Violators will be brought to book.\"",
